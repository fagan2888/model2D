# model2D
model2D is a data analysis pipeline designed to model the 2D light distribution of galaxies.
It is based on a series of python functions which produce a best-fit psf image, a bad-pixel mask and a galfit input file.

The python packages needed are: `main.py` , `pandas`, `astromatic_wrapper`, `astropy`, `pyraf`, `tqdm`
